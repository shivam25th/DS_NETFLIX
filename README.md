This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a rich movie dataset containing 9000+ records spanning multiple genres, ratings, and audience preferences. Using the powerful Python libraries Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I transformed raw, unstructured movie data into meaningful insights and visual stories.
